## Overview

A mobile app created to help people find and connect with new friends during lockdown periods. It aims to combat isolation by fostering meaningful interactions and building a supportive community, even when in-person meetups aren’t possible.

## Key Features

- **Swipe Feature**: A user-friendly swipe interface, familiar to our target demographic, inspired by popular apps like Tinder, Badoo, and Yubo. It makes connecting with others quick and intuitive.
- **Smart Location**: Customize your location preferences to connect with people nearby, ensuring that potential meetups are convenient and not too far away.
- **Chat Activity**: Engage in conversations with your matches to build meaningful friendships and strengthen connections.

## Technologies Used

- **Android**: The client side of the app was developed using Java for Android, chosen because of its widespread usage and support at the time of development. With a significant majority of smartphone users worldwide owning Android devices, Java ensured compatibility and performance, allowing us to reach the largest possible user base. Its robust APIs and extensive development tools also contributed to a seamless user experience.
- **PHP**: We chose PHP as our server-side language due to its stability, security, and reliability. PHP acts as the bridge between our database and the mobile app, efficiently handling user requests, managing data, and ensuring smooth communication between the server and client. Its robust ecosystem and wide adoption make it an excellent choice for maintaining the backend.
- **MySQL**: We use MySQL as our database solution to store and manage user profiles and related data. MySQL provides a highly scalable and efficient way to handle structured data, ensuring quick and reliable access to user information. Its compatibility with PHP and strong community support made it an ideal choice for this app.

## Challenges and Learnings

As a university project, we faced significant time constraints while juggling other modules and assignments, which limited the app's development. This resulted in several challenges, such as the incomplete implementation of the chat functionality, leaving users unable to communicate within the app. Additionally, we couldn’t dedicate sufficient time to security measures, making the app vulnerable to potential hacking attempts. The lack of advanced user filtering or selection criteria was another shortfall, as we couldn’t fully implement features to connect users with like-minded individuals. These limitations stemmed primarily from the restricted timeframe of the project.

## Outcome

The project resulted in a working demo that we showcased to our stakeholders. To make the presentation as engaging and professional as possible, I leveraged my video editing skills, utilizing motion graphics and typography principles to enhance the visual appeal and clarity of the demo. This approach helped communicate the app's potential in an impactful way.
